##  Depression Detection - Using SVM,RF and CNN Models
---
### Depression detection was done through extensive clinical interviews, wherein the subjectâ€™s responses are studied by the psychologist to determine his/her mental state .But with advancing technology, we tried to output the mental health of the patient using text and audio modalities using SVM, RF and CNN models.
 
<br/>
<br/>

## Using Dataset:
---
### The DAIC-WOZ dataset was collected by the University Of Southern California. It is a part of a larger DAIC (Distress Analysis Interview Corpus) that contains clinical interviews designed to support the diagnosis of psychological distress conditions such as anxiety, depression, and PTSD. For using this dataset, the permission from the university has to be granted.

## Files Attached:
---
### The ipynb files are preferred to be executed on Google Colab for faster execution.

*dataset_processing.py : used to obtain from the DAIC server, unzip them and arrange them in a manner we saw fit for easy implementation.
*svm&rf_text.py : used to run the SVM and RF models on the text modality.
*svm&rf_audio.py : used to run the SVM and RF models on the audio modality.
*svm&rf_text+audio.py : used to run SVM and RF models on both modalities.
*cnn_audio.py : used to run CNN on the audio features.
*cnn_text.py : used to run CNN on the text features.
